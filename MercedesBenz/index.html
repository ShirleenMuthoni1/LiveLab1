    luxury automakers, along with Audi and BMW, which are the best-selling luxury automakers

    <h2>Mercedes Benz today:</h2>

    <p>You don’t need me to tell you Mercedes is still incredibly popular today. While it is most 
        famous throughout the world for large luxury passenger cars, the company also has a strong 
        tradition in racing and sports cars and trucks, buses, and more economical car models. 
        The latter three are more common in non-US markets as Mercedes has always been exclusively 
        a luxury marque in the US.

    <br>They have continued to be at the forefront of innovation, most recently introducing the Vision
     Tokyo, a self-driving electric van powered by a hybrid hydrogen fuel-cell system. Cars currently 
     include a variety of models, from the A-Class through to the S Class, with a variety of derivatives
      in-between.</br>
    
    <br>Overall, the history of Mercedes-Benz is a story of innovation, engineering excellence, and 
    luxury. From its earliest days as a producer of advanced gasoline engines to its position today 
    as a top-tier luxury car brand, Mercedes-Benz has remained committed to producing cars that combine 
    performance, style, and luxury in equal measure.</br></p>
